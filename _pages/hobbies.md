### Broomball Committee - Senior Web Developer

I started my broomball career my freshman year of college. That year we made it to the championship game and even though we lost I was hooked. I then spent the next years of my time at tech winning championsips and being heavily involved with broomball. It was my Junior year that I got asked to apply for the Web Developer position. They needed someone that was able to manage the current website, improve upon it, and to help run the season through the website. I happily spent my past 2 years at Tech being a part of the broomball committee. I started two big projects for my web development team, documentation and a new website. When I joined the committee I saw a glaring lack of documentation on the website. There was nothing on common errors, past errors and fixes, or even how to do the yearly tasks on it. The website was also very old at this point. It was made about ten years ago and is in desperate need of a revamp. Beyond just needing a revamp I believe that building a new website will be invaluable experience to future web developers of broomball. After my two years I can say that documentation is looking better than ever before, we have increased the number of developers on the committee from two to three, and the new website is in development. 

### Roller Hockey Club - Vice-President

While attending MTU I found my family in roller hockey. I have raised thousands of dollars, set up sustainable fundraisers for the future, documented and backed up everything necessary for future presidents, and truly put my heart into the team. I have not missed a single tournament or event in my five years of MTU and would not change a single thing about it. I am glad to have helped the team grow from the bare minimum to play to a thriving team. I am leaving the team better than when I started and am looking forward to see what they accomplish in the future years. 

### MTU Linux Users Group

A weekly group that gets together and discusses linux news, school or personal projects. It is helping with my personal development and linux skills on a weekly basis. I find this really helpful for my personal server project as well as new information for my previous job. When you have a great group of people that are knowledgeable and passionate about the same thing, you end up learning so much that would be nearly impossible otherwise. 

### MTU Red Team Club

A computer security club that discusses security, hacks, exploits, and any personal issues that are afflicting the members. This club really helps me continue my education in the cyber security field. Since taking Computer Security class at MTU, I have a love for the field and this club helps me learn more, outside of the classroom. 

### League of Legends Club - Treasurer 

We hosted a 250+ person in house tournament every semester and with that came lots of planning, prep, money managment, and time. We would host the entire tournament in one night while providing internet, tables, switches, ethernet cables, food, and dinks to all the people in attendance. It was a great event planning activity that let me meet a multitude of new people when I first started my time at MTU. 

### MTU Club Ice Hockey Team

If roller hockey wasn't enough hockey in my life I also was part of the MTU Club Hockey Team, The Wolfpack. They have helped me develop as a person and a team member. We had many tough losses and exhilerating wins throughout my time there. I am proud to say that I was the starting goalie during my time there. 

### Husky Game Enterprises

This enterprise at MTU helped me take my passion for video games and let me create my own with a team. Through my year involved with the enterprise I made a mobile game with Unity and an arcade game with Java. I was the project manager of teams of five while also contributing my own code and development experience to the project. It was a great experience that I am so glad I was able to participate in. 

### Summer Outdoor Activities 

During the summer I love going outside hiking, camping, mountain biking, swimming, volleyball, and anything else that gets me outside and active. 

### Winter Outdoor Activities 

During the winter I stil spend most of my time outside or being active. I play hockey, snowboard, snowshoe, and cross country ski. 

### Animal Shelter Voulenteering 

Whether winter or summer I enjoy voulenteering my time to walking the dogs at the local shelter. I think it helps immensly for those dogs to be able to get out of their cage, even if beifly.
