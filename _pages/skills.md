### Puppet | 2016 - Present

I got introduced to Puppet during my 2016 summer internship. It is a great infrastructure automation tool that is used to manage entire server infrastructures. When I staretd working in the MTU DevOps lab I was tasked with converting RHEL 5 servers to Puppet managed RHEL 7 servers. This gave me incredible insight into system administration through the process. While developing puppet code I was also able to hone my professional Git skills, documentation making, and scripting ability. 

### Git | 2012 - Present

I started using Git in my first year as a Computer Science student. I have worked with countless teams through my education, and many more through my professional and personal projects. Every day Git seems a little less magic. I continue to use Git for all my class projects, this website, and other personal projects that I am working with. 

### C | 2013 - Present

I started using C in my second year of classes at MTU and it has quickly turned into a teacher favorite for complex projects. I used it in at least one class in each semester through college and am continuing to keep my skills sharp after graduation.  

### SQL | 2015 - Present

From my first SQL class, to the broomball website, to Team Software Project, SQL has been an instrumental part to many of my educational projects. While now I am only maintaining a database and no longer creating my own schema's I know the knowledge that I have gathered through the years will serve me well in the future with any database managment that is necessary. 

### Java | 2012 - 2014

This is the introductory language for MTU. While I haven't used much Java in the past couple years the object oriented programming mindsight is still strong in my mind. My classes have favored C as their prefered programming language and my projects have chosen different languages for various reasons. I know I would be able to pick up quickly where I was at and apply the knowledge and procedures that I have learned from using other languages. 

### Linux Administration | 2012 - Present

I started my own linux server when I was given very nice server hardware. I was immediatly intrueged with building a vritualized linux server to develop my skills with linux and host useful content. I now host a media server that deliver's all of my family's pictures and videos to each other anywhere in the world. Since I have a global family, having an easy way to distribute high quality pictures is imensly powerful. I continue to develop on my server and try new and exciting technologies on different KVMs. My experience with my personal server allowed me to get the summer internsihp at MTU as a DevOps Puppet Engineer. There I was able to develop professional Linux Administration skills.

### Project Management | 2014 - Present

When I worked at Aspirus Keweenaw Hospital I got my first courses on Project Managment. I then managed ten projects through my time there and took that experience to my education and future internships. I was able to be a project manager for all of my semesters in HGD, during Team Software Project, and with my Broomball Development Team. It has really showed me that my skills lie in project management and it convinced me to get a minor in psychology to help hone those skills. I look foward to being a team lead and project manager in my future positions. 

### Web Development | 2014 - Present

I have various skills in web development. I have experience in PHP, Python, HTML, CSS, Markdown, Database Managment, Server Deployment, and user help. I have written websites from scratch, come into projects that are years old, and deployed servers for exhisting websites. I love what the web has to offer and the amount of customization that you can do to deliver your content to the users. I continue to build new websites and manage old ones.
